# Introduction to AnyIO and Trio
## What Are AnyIO and Trio?
Let's imagine that our primary objective is achieving concurrency for I/O bound tasks. 
While we have been exploring `asyncio` in Python to support this goal,
additional tools such as `anyio` and `trio` offer valuable alternatives for enhancing I/O parallelism
which leverage the benefits of the `Structured Concurrency` design pattern. 
Their appeal lies in their user-friendly nature, enhanced features, and reduced learning curve,
making them attractive options for improving task efficiency.

### Why to use them?

 - **Improved Developer Productivity**: Simplified APIs and tools reduce the learning curve and development time.

 - **Cross-Framework Compatibility**: AnyIO ensures that our code can run on different async backends without modification.

 - **Enhanced Safety**: Trioâ€™s structured concurrency model reduces the likelihood of subtle bugs in concurrent code.




## Exploring Trio
`Trio`'s primary aim is to simplify the comprehension and enhance the performance of concurrency operations.
It offers a more efficient GIL and higher-level APIs, resulting in code that is easier to understand and troubleshoot.
