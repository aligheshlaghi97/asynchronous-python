# Task Scheduling and Queues: Celery, APScheduler, and Beyond
## Introduction to Task Scheduling and Queues

Task scheduling and message queues are essential for handling long-running tasks,
periodic jobs, and inter-component communication in modern applications.
They help improve scalability, resilience, and efficiency by decoupling workflows and managing workloads asynchronously.

Libraries like `Celery` and `APScheduler` are popular tools for implementing task scheduling and queuing in Python.
They allow developers to offload tasks, schedule recurring jobs, and handle retries seamlessly.
In this section, weâ€™ll explore these tools and learn how to design scalable, asynchronous task systems.
