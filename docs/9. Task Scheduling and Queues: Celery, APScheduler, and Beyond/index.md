# Task Scheduling and Queues: Celery, APScheduler, and Beyond
## Introduction to Task Scheduling and Queues

Task scheduling and message queues are essential for handling long-running tasks,
periodic jobs, and inter-component communication in modern applications.
They help improve scalability, resilience, and efficiency by decoupling workflows and managing workloads asynchronously.

Libraries like `Celery` and `APScheduler` are popular tools for implementing task scheduling and queuing in Python.
They allow developers to offload tasks, schedule recurring jobs, and handle retries seamlessly.
In this section, weâ€™ll explore these tools and learn how to design scalable, asynchronous task systems.

## Getting Started with Celery

First install `celery` on your system with pip.
Then you have to installed `RabbitMQ` on your system and make sure it is enabled or setup using docker.

Then create these python files. In first one we initiate backend and broker of celery.
```python
# ex_9_1
{% include_relative ex_9_1.py %}
```

In this one we run and get the celery task's result and check if it ready or not.
```python
# ex_9_2
{% include_relative ex_9_2.py %}
```

In the third file, we run and sleep to get the celery task's result and check if it ready or not.
```python
# ex_9_3
{% include_relative ex_9_3.py %}
```

After all change directory to chapter9 and run this command and then run `ex_9_2.py` and `ex_9_3.py` files:
```shell
celery -A ex_9_1 worker --loglevel=INFO
```
